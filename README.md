# pywal (A `wal` rewrite in Python 3)

[![PyPI](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/pywal.svg)](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pywal/) [![MIT licensed](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg)](./LICENSE.md) [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/dylanaraps/pywal.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/dylanaraps/pywal)


`wal` is a script that takes an image (or a directory of images), generates a colorscheme (using `imagemagick`) and then changes all of your open terminal's colors to the new colorscheme on the fly. `wal` then caches each generated colorscheme so that cycling through wallpapers while changing colorschemes is instantaneous.

`wal` also merges the new colorscheme into the Xresources database so that programs on your system such as `Rofi` or `i3` use the new colors automatically. `wal` finally exports the colors into various formats so that you can use the colors in webpages, scripts, other programs etc.

For more info, check out the [Wiki](https://github.com/dylanaraps/pywal/wiki).

**NOTE:** `wal` is not perfect and won't work well with some images.

## Requirements


### Dependencies

- `linux`
- `python 3.6`
- `imagemagick`
    - Colorscheme generation.
- `xfce`, `gnome`, `cinnamon`, `mate`
    - Desktop wallpaper setting.
- `feh`, `nitrogen`, `bgs`, `hsetroot`, `habak`
    - Universal wallpaper setting.


### Terminal Emulator

To use `wal` your terminal emulator must support a special type of escape sequence. The command below can be used as a test to see if `wal` will work with your setup.

Run the command below, does the background color of your terminal become red?

```sh
printf "%b" "\033]11;#ff0000\007"
```

If your terminal's background color is now red, your terminal should work with `wal`.

## Installation

https://github.com/dylanaraps/pywal/wiki/Installation


## Setup

**NOTE:** If you get junk in your terminal, add `-t` to all of the `wal` commands.

### Applying the theme to new terminals.

`wal` only applies the new colors to the currently open terminals. Any new terminal windows you open won't be using the new theme unless you add a single line to your shell's start up file. (`.bashrc`, `.zshrc` etc.) The `-r` flags tells `wal` to find the current colorscheme inside the cache and then set it for the new terminal.

Add this line to your shell startup file. (`.bashrc`, `.zshrc` or etc.)

```sh
# Import colorscheme from 'wal'
(wal -r &)

# If the command above doesn't work,
# try this alternative.
setsid wal -r
```

Here's how the extra syntax above works:

```sh
&   # Run the process in the background.
( ) # Hide shell job control messages.
```

### Making the colorscheme persist on reboot.

On reboot your new colorscheme won't be set or in use. To fix this you have to add a line to your `.xinitrc` or whatever file starts programs on your system. This `wal` command will set your wallpaper to the wallpaper that was set last boot and also apply the colorscheme again.

Without this you'll be themeless until you run `wal` again on boot.

```sh
# Add this to your .xinitrc or whatever file starts programs on startup.
wal -i "$(< "${HOME}/.cache/wal/wal")"
```


## Usage

Run `wal` and point it to either a directory (`wal -i "path/to/dir"`) or an image (`wal -i "/path/to/img.jpg"`) and that's all. `wal` will change your wallpaper for you and also set your terminal colors.

```sh
usage: wal [-h] [-c] [-i "/path/to/img.jpg"]
                   [-f "/path/to/colorscheme/file"] [-n] [-o "script_name"]
                   [-q] [-r] [-t] [-v]
